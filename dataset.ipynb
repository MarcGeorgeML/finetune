flavor symmetry and its breaking effects can systematically be evaluated via the power of inverse heavy quark mass @xmath8 .\\nthe effective theory of heavy quark has been widely applied to heavy hadron systems , such as b decays into heavy hadrons via both exclusive and inclusive decay modes .\\nthere are two different versions of effective theory of heavy quark .\\none is the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , which generally decouples the `` quark fields '' and `` antiquark fields '' and treats one of them independently .\\nthis treatment is only valid when taking the heavy quark mass to be infinite . in the real world , mass of quark must be finite , thus one should keep in the effective lagrangian both the effective quark and effective antiquark fields .\\nbased on this consideration , a heavy quark effective field theory ( hqeft ) @xcite has been established and investigated with including the effects of the mixing terms between quark and antiquark fields .\\nits applications to the pair annihilation and creation have also been studied in the literature@xcite .\\nthough the hqeft explicitly deviate from hqet from the next - to - leading order , these two formulations of effective theory trivially coincide with each other at the infinite heavy quark mass limit . in our knowledge the exclusive heavy to light ( pseudoscalar ) decay channels have been discussed in @xcite , where the matrix elements in the effective theory have been formulated , but the two leading order wave functions have not been calculated .    in this paper we focus on the calculation of the leading order wave functions of @xmath6 decay by using the light cone sum rule in the effective theory of heavy quark . as an important application , @xmath1 is extracted . in section 2\\n, the h...\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '@xmath0 decay is studied in the effective theory of heavy quark with infinite mass limit . the leading order heavy flavor -
